An exercice in JS to replicate an old program I made a long time ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-y0GZhf5kE

Each body is made up of body parts, and animations specify keyframes for the rotation of each of them.
Each body part corresponds to a sprite image, which means that changing sprites will yield similar animations with different looks.

The UI is a little nicer, and the animations smoother :)
